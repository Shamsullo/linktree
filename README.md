##About
One my friend recently start an online business card that can me shared via nfs tags. Mostly his audience are youth, they collect their social media links in one place 
so they could share through the tag. Now, he is using [linktree](https://linktr.ee/) and [taplink] (https://taplink.ru/profile/5827033/pages/) for this purpose. But a couple weeks a go his asked me what if I will write him his own link sharing website. 
And this is how this project get started, in my free times I come down to this project and contribute at an easy pace. 

### Application workflow
User will register to the site using their phone number be sms-code verification. They can create their board of links (business card), add the desired link and their board is ready to be shared. they just need to copy the created link and share wherever is needed.  Users also are able to update their profile infomation, phone number, password and restore thir password when they don't remember it.
